Directions for Future Development:

Weather API: 
*Add a minimum/maximum temp range
*Change Date and Time to look more appealing.
*Add modal with try/catch method to notify user when zip code input is bad.

Map Functionality:
*Working trail list buttons to set coordinates to map (Trail name buttons are currently dummy buttons.)
